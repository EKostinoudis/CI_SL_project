# CI_SL_project
Classification and clustering with different algorithms on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

## Structure

- *kpca_plus_lda.py* has a python implementation of the kernel PCA plus LDA algorithm.
- *spectral_embeddings.py* has a python implementation of the spectral embeddings used
  in spectral clustering.
- *datasets* folder has the code and data for loading and downloading the data.
- *mnist.ipynb*, *cifar.ipynb* has the code for classification with SVM models.
- *mnist_kpca_lda.ipynb*, *cifar_kpca_lda.ipynb* has the code for classification with 
  KPCA+LDA preprocessing.
- *mnist_clustering.ipynb*, *cifar_clustering.ipynb* has the code for spectral clustering.
